First of all VBScript is an interpreted language and does not need to be compiled.

But yes, you can debug your VBScript file inside VS2013. Just open the file you want to debug with VS2013. Under "Tools / External Tools" you have to register the Windows Script Host (CScript.exe or WScript.exe) with some startup parameters:
Title:             CScript Debug
Command:           C:\Windows\System32\cscript.exe
Arguments:         //nologo //X $(ItemPath)
Initial directory: $(ItemDir)
Check "Use Output window"
Hit the OK button

In order to start the debugger, just click "Tools / CScript Debug". The VS JIT debugger asks you, wich debugger you want to use. Just select your *.vbs file and click Yes.

Sometimes it is a bit buggy but it works. ;-)
